    title: `The Rooster and the Sun`,
    description: `Once upon a time, there was a proud rooster who believed he was the most important creature in the world. Every morning, he crowed loudly, thinking his voice was what made the sun rise. One day, he had an argument with the Sun, claiming that he alone could make the world wake up. The Sun smiled and explained that every being has a unique role. The rooster's crowing might wake people up, but without the Sun, the world would remain dark. So, every day, the rooster proudly crowed, while the Sun rose to light the world.`,

    description: `
A rooster was happily strutting around the farm when he encountered a sly fox. The fox flattered him, saying, "You are the most magnificent rooster I've ever seen. You should sing for a crowd!" The rooster, flattered by the praise, considered it. But the wise rooster, realizing the fox's intentions, quickly replied, "I sing for those who value it, not for praise or empty flattery." And with that, the rooster flew up to a high branch, escaping the fox's trickery.`,

    title: 'The Rooster and the Farmer',
    description: `A farmer had a rooster that crowed every morning without fail. One morning, the rooster slept in. The farmer, in a panic, ran outside to make sure the rooster was still alive. "Why didnâ€™t you crow today?" the farmer asked. The rooster simply replied, "I crowed so many days, I thought I'd let the world sleep for once." The farmer chuckled and said, "Even the rooster needs a break sometimes." From that day on, the rooster only crowed when he truly felt it was time to wake up the world.`,

    title: 'The Rooster and the Hen',
    description: `A rooster and a hen lived together on the farm. Every day, the rooster would crow at dawn, but the hen was the one who did all the work, laying eggs and keeping the farm organized. One day, the rooster asked the hen, "Why do you always work so hard while I get to crow and take it easy?" The hen smiled and replied, "Because while you bring attention to the day, I help keep it running smoothly. We each play our part." The rooster realized that both of them were important in their own way and they should appreciate each other's efforts.
